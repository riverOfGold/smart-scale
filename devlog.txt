I did an acid test with the HX711 and a 1kg rated load cell.  It works.
Between the HX711 there are four wires connected and their labelling is
obvious: red wire to RED connector, green wire to GRN connector etc.

Between the HX711 and the Raspberry Pi are five wires:
     - VCC connects to a 5V pin on the RPi (board pin 2)
     - VDD connects to the 3.3V pin on the RPi (board pin 1)
     - GND connects to a ground pin on the RPi (board pin 6)
     - DAT connects to the GPIO5 on the RPi (board pin 31)
     - CLK connects to the GPIO6 on the RPi (board pin 33)

I ran the following git command:
     $ git clone https://github.com/tatobari/hx711py

Then I ran the "example.py" script --> no load applied yet.

It began printing out values to the terminal.  I put my calibration 
weight onto the scale (it was a 700g ham) and once it settled out I
divided that number by 700.  1644800 / 700 = 2350.

Then I went into the "example.py" file (in the git repo I cloned) and 
inputted that 2350 number in the line of code where it asks for a 
"referenceUnit" variable.
